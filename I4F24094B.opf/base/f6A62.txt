(p. 90) 13th Imperishable: Joy.

Further, reverend Śāradvatīputra, the great joy of the bodhisattvas is also imperishable.What then is great joy?

It is gladness, harmony and delight resulting from remembrance and recollection of the qualities of a Buddha;absence of d
ejection and depression in thought;absence of thirst for pleasure;doing away with all delight in pleasure,it is the basi
s of all delight in religion;delight in thought, excitement in body, fascination of the intellect and happiness of mind;
the joy and delight caused by the body of the Tathāgata and skill in searching for his ornaments consisting in the prima
ry characteristics and the secondary marks of beauty;absence of fatigue when listening to the good religion;gladness, ha
rmony and delight in the accomplishment of confidence in the essential moments of existence,the happiness of the one thu
s delighted with regard to these moments of existence;always to have a mind free from aversion towards living beings,and
intense desire in searching for the qualities of the Buddha, not laying aside that desire;reliance on, and freedom in t
he great religion of the Buddha and producing thoughts drawn away from limited religious ways;producing thoughts not nar
rowed down by meanness;the desire to give to those who ask, the giver’s triply purified delight in giving after having g
iven;always feeling harmony with moral people, but being pleased to help the immoral, by one’s own purity of morality gi
ving the consolation that the fear of any bad destiny can be transcended;transforming [one’s own morality by purifying i
t] into the morality of the Tathāgata;firmness [so as not to come into the power of bad moments of existence] and unbrea
kableness;thoughts which are not hostile, tolerance and gentleness towards others whose ways of speech are wicked and ba
d;absence of conceit;respect consisting in bowing to and revering teachers;always a smiling face and no sternness;readin
ess to speak;absence of hypocrisy, boasting or threatening;pure intention, no harshness in thought and no fraudulence;se

ove for preachers of religion like love for all kinds of riches;love for all the qualities of a Buddha like love for the
jewel which grants all wishes;love for admonitions like love for all joy and pleasure;love for contentment like love fo
r health;love for seeking religion like love for medicines;love for those who urge one on and make one mindful like love
for a physician.

[To summarize:] Reverend Śāradvatīputra, this resilience of the faculties in all one’s faculties is said to be great joy.

Great joy has the form [or essence (svabhāva) ] of peace since it is the knowledge of understanding;the form of absolute 
peace since it is the absence of haughtiness;the form of tranquility since it is the absence of arrogance [which is not 
to have given up the vices (kleśa) ];the form of joy of the senses since it is not distracted [because of concentration 
(samādhi) ];the form of ascetic commitment since it is the absence of forgetfulness;the form of gentleness since it is w
ished for [by all, being pleasant];the form of listening since it is gentleness in speech;the form of calmness since it 
is fitness of thought;the form of contentment since it is action well done;the form of no regret since it is faultless [
having done no sin];the form of being well established since it is immovable [by hostile forces, etc. (vipakṣâdi) ];the 
form of being immovable since it is not established in any particular place [among things (bhāva) and distinguishing mar
ks (nimitta) ];the form of being hard to conquer since it is hard to subdue;the form of real meaning since it is never l
ost;the form of truth since it is never different from what it is;the form of reality since it effects just that;the for
m of effort since it is power;the form of power since it is uncrushable;the form of fulfilling the qualities of the Budd
ha through not getting tired of seeking the qualities of the Buddha in the right way.

This, reverend Śāradvatīputra, is the bodhisattvas’ imperishable great joy.
