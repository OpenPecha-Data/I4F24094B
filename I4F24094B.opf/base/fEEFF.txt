24th Imperishable: Knowledge of The Meaning.

What then is knowledge of the meaning [or the individual essential characteristics (pṛthaglakṣaṇa) ]?

Knowledge of the real meaning in all moments of existence,i. e., knowledge of the moments of existence [knowledge that th
e conditioned (saṃskṛta) things in the sphere of passion (kāmadhātu) have the essential characteristic (lakṣaṇa) and nat
ure (dharmatā) of suffering (duḥkha) and impermanence (anityatā) ];reflective knowledge [knowing the essential character
istic of the causes (hetu) and conditions (pratyaya) in the origin (hetusamudaya) from which the suffering in the same s
phere (dhātu) stems];successive knowledge [namely that of the above-mentioned characteristics in the spheres of form (rū
padhātu) and no form (ārūpyadhātu) also];knowledge of [the meaning and essential characteristics of the six kinds of] ca
uses;knowledge of conditions;knowledge of the combinations [of causes and conditions as they bring about fruit];knowledg

tent in the highest meaning (paramârthatas) ];knowledge of not going to any extreme;knowledge of not remaining in the mi
ddle;[but still] knowledge of understanding the conditions [involved in dependent origination (pratītyasamutpāda) ];know

existence [which is emptiness (śūnyatā) ];knowledge of understanding emptiness;knowledge of behaviour with no distinguis

ng when confronted with the unconditioned;knowledge of penetrating the one principle [or the one essential characteristi
c (ekalakṣaṇa) of all moments of existence];knowledge understanding selflessness,knowledge understanding no being,knowle
dge understanding no life-principle,knowledge of the highest truth of no personality;knowledge not attached to the past;
knowledge of the future as unsettled [having no end, being imperishable (akṣaya), or, unhindered knowledge of future eve
nts];knowledge of the present as wholly unblamable [since no aversion or attraction arises understanding the present thi
ngs as without essence (niḥsvabhāva) ];knowledge of illusion when concerned with the parts of personality [as created by
a magician (māyākāra) ];knowledge seeing the spheres of sense-perception as snake-poison [killing fast the roots of goo
d (kuśalamūla) ];knowledge of introspection concerned with the fields of sense-perception as empty villages [without any

the essence of insight (prajñāsvabhāva) ];knowledge of seeing [the essence (svabhāva) of] the self;knowledge of seeing w
hen it concerns the truths;knowledge of non-origination when it concerns suffering;knowledge of the unconditioned when i
t concerns the origin [of suffering];knowledge of no distinguishing marks when it concerns cessation [of suffering];know
ledge of liberating [from the ocean of existence (saṃsārasamudra) ] when it concerns the way [to cessation of suffering]
;knowledge of the divisions of words concerning the moments of existence [knowing how to explain their meaning (artha) ]
;knowledge of no recollection and no mental effort when it concerns the practice of recollection;knowledge understanding
both the good and the bad [so as to increase the good and get rid of the bad] when it concerns correct exertions;knowle
dge of the swiftness of body and mind when concerned with the bases of magic [making body and thought useful (kāyacittak

ing all moments of existence as they are when concerned with the limbs of awakening;knowledge of no going and no coming 
when concerned with the way;knowledge of remaining when concerned with peaceful meditation;knowledge of manifestation wh
en concerned with expanded vision;knowledge of [deceptive] creations [of, e.g., elephants and men created by means of in
cantations (mantra) or drugs (auṣadha) ] when confronted with illusions;the knowledge of misunderstanding [air for water
] when confronted with a mirage;knowledge of seeing irreality [of the moments of existence appearing] in a dream;knowled
ge of apprehending the condition [namely that it arises from another sound] for the echo;knowledge of the unchanging [on
which the images are projected] when concerned with images;knowledge [as explained in the section on truth] of the one 
characteristic in what has different characteristics;knowledge of disintegration in combinations [that all composite thi
ngs in the end disintegrate];knowledge of no connection [from the moments of existence in one birth to those in another 
birth, when viewed from the standpoint of the highest meaning (paramārtha) ] in connections;knowledge of understanding i
n accordance with the words of others [of teachers and preceptors (ācārôpādhyāya) ] when concerned with the way of disci
ples;knowledge understanding dependence [of phenomena on each other], knowledge of staying apart [in body] and one-point
edness [of thought] when concerned with the way of the isolated buddhas;(p. 110) knowledge of begetting accumulations of
the roots of good when concerned with the great way.This is knowledge of the meaning.

Further about knowledge of the meaning: knowledge of the meaning is that by which one relies on all moments of existence 
through reliance on the meaning.Why?

All moments of existence are absolutely empty, and the meaning which is emptiness is the meaning concerned;all moments of
existence are completely without distinguishing marks, and the meaning which is being without distinguishing marks is t
he meaning concerned;all moments of existence are completely beyond longing, and the meaning which is being beyond longi
ng is the meaning concerned;all moments of existence are completely unconditioned, and the meaning which is being uncond
itioned is the meaning concerned;all moments of existence are completely beyond origination [in the future], and the mea
ning which is complete non-origination is the meaning concerned;all moments of existence are completely unborn [in the p
ast], and the meaning which is complete unbornness is the meaning concerned;all moments of existence are completely inex
istent [having no own nature (svabhāva) in the present], and the meaning which is complete inexistence is the meaning co
ncerned;all moments of existence are completely separate [since essentially being what they are (tathatāsvabhāvatvāt) ],
and the meaning which is complete separatedness is the meaning concerned;all moments of existence are completely withou
t self, being, life-principle, personality, and the meaning which is no self, being, life-principle or personality is th
e meaning concerned.

Understanding moments of existence this way is knowledge of the meaning.

[To summarize:] The teaching concerning this is an unhindered teaching, unattached teaching, imperishable teaching, a tea
ching of attaining all moments of existence; that teaching of meaning is knowledge of the meaning.That knowledge of the 
meaning is imperishable in displaying all meaning,even the Lord Buddhas teach it and are pleased [when others teach it].
[That is because] it is true, essentially no lie and no other than itself,it is the wholly unblamable understanding thro
ugh insight and knowledge.

This is knowledge of the meaning.
