4th Imperishable: Determination.

Further, reverend Śāradvatīputra, the determination of the bodhisattvas is also imperishable.

[1. To show that determination is essentially imperishable (svabhāvākṣayatādeśanārtham); and in what the imperishability 
consists (yākṣayatā), it is said:]Why? Because it rests upon all the roots of the good;whatever the bodhisattva thinks u
ltimately rests upon the roots of good because of his determination.It is the determination to pass on since it is to st
ay on one stage after another;;the determination to cross over since it is going to a different state [beyond the threef
old world (traidhātuka-) ];the highest determination since it is distinguished [from the determination of disciples and 
isolated buddhas, as that of the isolated buddhas is distinguished from that of the disciples];the distinguished determi
nation because of [gradually] grasping [superior qualities (adhikaguṅa) being] different moments of existence;the determ
ination having all the qualities of a Buddha clearly in view;the determination resting upon moments of existence disting
uished [from earlier stages of development];the determination to carry through all undertakings;the persevering determin
ation because of indefatigability in perseverance;the determination of perfected vows because of fulfilling the vows;the
unassailable determination since one has only oneself as companion [when realizing incomparable awakening (anuttarabodh
i) ];the determination on the stage of being well trained [like a horse] because of the absence of unruliness;the determ
ination on the stage of being disciplined because of nobility;the unmixed determination because of non-contamination wit
h the vices of untrained beings;the determination of giving gifts hard to give because of giving even the head, the best
part of the body, the determination of morality hard to practise because of protection for the immoral, the determinati
on of tolerance hard to endure because of putting up with the faults of weak beings, the determination of vigour hard to
practise because of giving up the awakening of disciples and isolated buddhas even while having it at hand, the determi
nation of meditation hard to practise because of not tasting meditation [which is the highest pleasure in the world], th
e determination of insight hard to practise because of not deriding the accumulation of any root of the good;the determi
nation to carry through any practice undertaken because of completing the duties of all beings;the determination free fr
om conceit, pride, haughtiness, self-conceit, self-esteem, pride of modesty and illusory pride because of discerning wit
h knowledge;the determination of regarding all beings as worthy of gifts because of not hoping for recompense;the determ
ination of fearlessness because of understanding the deep religion of the Buddhas;the determination to go to a different
state because of progressing by means of powers [like insight (prajñā) and so on];the determination to never be fainthe
arted because of helping those carrying burdens [of four kinds, that of the parts of personality (skandhabhāra), vices (
kleśabhāra), promises (pratijñābhāra) or vigour (vīryabhāra) ];the imperishable determination because of constant alertn
ess [to maturing living beings and the qualities of a Buddha (sattvabuddhadharmaparipākāya) ];

[2. To show that its action is imperishable (kāryākṣayatādeśanārtham), and how it is imperishable (yathākṣayatā):]Further
, determination is said to be kindness to [non-human] beings, friendliness to living beings, thoughts for the weal of th
e noble, care for the not noble, respect for the masters;protection for the unprotected, a refuge for those without refu
ge, an island for the shipwrecked, an ideal for those without ideals, friendship to the friendless;straightness to the c
rooked, correctness to the unruly, absence of fraud to the fraudulent, absence of trickery to the dissemblers;gratitude 
to the ungrateful, thankfulness to the harmful, help to the unhelpful, truth to the mistaken;humility to the stubborn, n
o reproach to the virtuous, not proclaiming the mistakes of others, protection to those who behave wrongly, not seeing f
aults in any practice of ability in skilful means, homage to all worthy of offerings;adequate obedience to admonitions; 
happiness in mind at instructions and admonitions;respecting hermits;no desire for gain, honour and fame;no regard for o
ne’s own body or life [in seeking true religion and doing the good for living beings];no hypocrisy because of pure deter
mination;no boasting because of restraint in speech;no threats [and thus using force (balāt) ] because of contentment wi
th what one has;responsiveness [being freed from grasping for bad places, staying concentrated] because of no impurity o
f thought;inclination towards existence because of accumulation of all roots of the good;enduring any suffering [giving 
up thought-constructions (vikalpa) concerned with hard and easy] because of concern for all beings;

[3. To show that its cause is imperishable (hetvakṣayatādeśanārtham), and that by which it is imperishable (yair akṣayatā
):] Thus the determinations of those good men are all imperishable; all vices of existence cannot make them perish since
they are supported by all merit; since they are the nourishment of all beings; since by them one attains imperishable k
nowledge [or, omniscience (sarvajñajñāna) ];

This, reverend Śāradvatīputra, is called the bodhisattvas’ imperishable determination.
